# R2 Storage School Isolation Implementation

## Overview
Implemented complete data isolation for media uploads in Cloudflare R2 storage by organizing files into school-specific folders. Each school's media is now stored in separate directories, ensuring complete data separation.

## Storage Structure

### ‚ùå OLD Structure (Shared/Flat)
```
R2 Bucket/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1234567890_photo1.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1234567891_photo2.png
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ videos/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1234567892_video1.mp4
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ thumbnails/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1234567893_thumb1.jpg
```
**Problem:** All schools' files mixed together, no isolation

### ‚úÖ NEW Structure (School-Isolated)

## Files Modified

### 1. **image_uploader_page.dart**
**Change:** Image uploads now use school-specific path
```dart
// OLD: final key = 'images/${timestamp}_$name';
// NEW: 
final schoolId = SchoolContext.currentSchoolId ?? 'default';
final key = 'schools/$schoolId/images/${timestamp}_$name';
```

### 2. **multi_video_uploader_page.dart**
**Change:** Video and thumbnail uploads use school-specific paths
```dart
// Videos
String _buildVideoKey(String name) {
  final schoolId = SchoolContext.currentSchoolId ?? 'default';
  return 'schools/$schoolId/videos/${ts}_$safe';
}

// Thumbnails
String _buildThumbKey(String name) {
  final schoolId = SchoolContext.currentSchoolId ?? 'default';
  return 'schools/$schoolId/thumbnails/${ts}_$base.jpg';
}
```

### 3. **multi_r2_uploader_page.dart**
**Change:** R2 multi-upload uses school-specific paths
- Added import: `import 'services/school_context.dart';`
- Videos: `'schools/$schoolId/videos/${ts}_$name'`
- Thumbnails: Automatically placed in `schools/$schoolId/thumbnails/`

### 4. **youtube_uploader_page.dart**
**Change:** YouTube backup uploads to R2 use school-specific paths
- Added import: `import 'services/school_context.dart';`
- Videos: `'schools/$schoolId/videos/${timestamp}_${file.name}'`
- Thumbnails: `'schools/$schoolId/thumbnails/${timestamp}_${baseName}.jpg'`

### 5. **functions/index.js** (Firebase Functions)
**Change:** Cleanup function updated to support both structures
```javascript
const foldersToClean = [
  'images/', 'videos/', 'thumbnails/', 'pdfs/', 'documents/',  // Legacy
  'schools/'  // New school-specific structure (cleans all schools)
];
```

## Benefits

### üîí **Complete Data Isolation**
- Each school's media is physically separated in R2 storage
- No risk of cross-school data leakage
- Easy to identify and manage school-specific content

### üìä **Better Organization**
- Clear hierarchy: `schools/{SCHOOL_ID}/{media-type}/`
- Simple to audit storage usage per school
- Easy to implement school-specific quotas/limits

### üóëÔ∏è **Easier Cleanup**
- Can delete entire school folder when school is removed
- School-specific retention policies possible
- Simpler backup/restore per school

### üí∞ **Future Billing Support**
- Track storage usage per school
- Implement per-school storage limits
- Generate usage reports by school

### üîß **Backwards Compatible**
- Cleanup function still handles legacy flat structure
- Existing files remain accessible
- Gradual migration possible

## URL Format

### Old URLs:
```
https://account.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/images/1234567890_photo.jpg
https://custom-domain.com/videos/1234567891_video.mp4
```

### New URLs:
```
https://account.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/schools/SCHOOL_ABC_123456/images/1234567890_photo.jpg
https://custom-domain.com/schools/SCHOOL_ABC_123456/videos/1234567891_video.mp4
```

---

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments:
1. **No immediate action required** - New uploads automatically use new structure
2. **Old files remain accessible** - Cleanup function handles both structures
3. **Optional migration** - Can run script to move old files to school folders (future enhancement)

### For New Deployments:
- All files automatically organized by school from day one
- No migration needed

---

## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ **Access Control**
- Files are already protected by R2 bucket policies
- School ID embedded in path prevents accidental access
- Consider implementing school-specific R2 access tokens (future enhancement)

### ‚úÖ **Data Privacy**
- Each school's data physically separated
- Easier GDPR/data deletion compliance
- School removal = simple folder deletion

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
- SchoolContext.currentSchoolId must be set before uploads
- Uses 'default' as fallback if schoolId not found
- Ensure SchoolContext is properly initialized at app startup

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test image upload from announcements page
- [ ] Test video upload from announcements page
- [ ] Test multi-video upload
- [ ] Test YouTube video backup to R2
- [ ] Verify thumbnail generation uses correct path
- [ ] Test file retrieval/playback
- [ ] Verify URLs are correctly formed with school ID
- [ ] Test cleanup function (development environment only)
- [ ] Check different schools don't see each other's files

---

## Future Enhancements

### üìà **Storage Analytics**
```javascript
// Possible function to get per-school storage usage
exports.getSchoolStorageUsage = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  const schoolId = data.schoolId;
  const prefix = `schools/${schoolId}/`;
  // Calculate total size under this prefix
});
```

### üîê **School-Specific Access Tokens**
- Generate temporary signed URLs per school
- Implement school-specific bucket policies
- Add expiring download links

### üì¶ **School Data Export**
- Export all school media as zip
- Backup specific school's R2 folder
- Data portability compliance

### üóÑÔ∏è **Migration Tool**
```dart
// Tool to migrate legacy flat structure to school folders
Future<void> migrateLegacyFiles() async {
  // 1. Query all images/videos from Firestore
  // 2. Check if they have schoolId field
  // 3. Copy files from old path to new school-specific path
  // 4. Update Firestore references
  // 5. Delete old files after verification
}
```
