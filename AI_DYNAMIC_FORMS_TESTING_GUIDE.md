2. Enter prompt:
```
Add a checkbox for hostel accommodation and a number field for roll number
```

3. Generate → Preview → Add
4. Form should now have **new fields added** to existing ones

**Expected Result**:
- Existing fields remain unchanged
- New fields appear at the bottom
- Roll number field accepts only numbers
- Checkbox appears as toggle

---

### Step 8: Test Field Types

## 🧪 Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Scenario A: Complex Field Generation
**Prompt**: 
```
Create a comprehensive student profile with: emergency contact name and phone, previous school name, admission date, fee concession checkbox, sibling name (optional), and any medical conditions as a long text area
```

**Verify**:
- AI generates 7+ fields
- Types are appropriate (date for admission, checkbox for concession, textarea for medical)
- Optional fields don't have asterisk
- All fields render and save correctly

---

### Scenario B: Date Field Testing
**Test multiple date fields**:
1. Add fields: Date of Birth, Admission Date, Last School Leaving Date
2. Verify date picker works for all
3. Save student and verify dates display in DD/MM/YYYY format
4. Check Firestore shows dates as Timestamp objects

---

### Scenario C: Dropdown Options
**Prompt**: 
```
Add a dropdown for class section with options: A, B, C, D, E
```

**Verify**:
- Dropdown shows exactly 5 options
- No extra/missing options
- Selection saves correctly
- Displays in student list

---

### Scenario D: Long Form Submission
**Create a form with 15+ fields** and fill all, then save

**Verify**:
- Form scrolls smoothly
- No UI lag
- All fields save to Firestore
- Displays correctly in list (may truncate some fields)

---

### Scenario E: Special Characters
**Test with special characters**:
- Name: "O'Brien-Smith"
- Email: "test+student@school.co.in"
- Address: "Flat #12, 2nd Floor, B/Wing"

**Verify**:
- All special characters save correctly
- Display without corruption
- No JSON parsing errors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No form fields configured"
**Cause**: Form config not yet created in Firestore
**Solution**: Use AI button to generate first set of fields

---

### Issue: AI generation fails with error
**Possible Causes**:
1. API key not configured → Go to Settings → Media Storage Settings → Gemini AI Config
2. No internet connection → Check device connectivity
3. API quota exceeded (unlikely with free tier) → Wait 1 minute and retry

**Check in Firestore**:
- Collection: `app_config`
- Document: `gemini_config`
- Field: `apiKey` should have your key
- Field: `enabled` should be `true`

---

### Issue: Fields don't render after adding
**Solution**: 
1. Close and reopen AI Students page
2. Check Firestore: `app_config/students_form_config` should exist
3. Verify `fields` array has data

---

### Issue: Date picker doesn't open
**Solution**: Ensure you're tapping the date field itself, not the label

---

### Issue: Dropdown shows empty list
**Cause**: AI didn't generate options or field config missing `options` array
**Solution**: Regenerate field with clearer prompt, e.g., "gender dropdown with options Male, Female, Other"

---

### Issue: Data not saving
**Check**:
1. All required fields filled?
2. Form validation passed (no red error text)?
3. Firestore rules allow admin to write to `students` collection?
4. Internet connection active?

---

## 🔍 Firestore Data Structure

### After successful field generation:
```
app_config (collection)
  └── students_form_config (document)
        └── fields (array)
              ├── {name: "studentName", type: "text", label: "Name", required: true}
              ├── {name: "dateOfBirth", type: "date", label: "Date of Birth", required: true}
              ├── {name: "gender", type: "dropdown", label: "Gender", required: true, options: ["Male", "Female", "Other"]}
              └── ... more fields
```

### After saving a student:
```
students (collection)
  └── {auto-generated-id} (document)
        ├── studentName: "Rahul Sharma"
        ├── dateOfBirth: Timestamp(2010-03-15)
        ├── gender: "Male"
        ├── bloodGroup: "O+"
        ├── parentName: "Mr. Rajesh Sharma"
        ├── parentPhone: "9876543210"
        ├── email: "rahul.sharma@school.com"
        ├── address: "123 MG Road, Mumbai"
        └── createdAt: Timestamp(now)
```

## 📝 Notes for School Administrators

- **Keep prompts clear**: Be specific about field types (dropdown, date, checkbox)
- **Specify options**: For dropdowns, list the options you want
- **Use common names**: "Name" instead of "studentFullName" for clarity
- **Review before adding**: Always check the preview to ensure fields are correct
- **Start small**: Add 5-8 fields first, test, then add more
- **Can't edit fields**: Currently you can only add fields. To change a field, you'll need to clear the form config and regenerate

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing

Once testing is complete and successful:

1. **Build Production APK**:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

2. **Test APK on Physical Device**:
   - Install the APK
   - Test all scenarios again
   - Ensure no debug-only features break

3. **Push to Git** (all three remotes):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add AI-powered dynamic form generation with Gemini API"
   git push testing main
   git push backup main
   git push system main
   ```

4. **Documentation**:
   - Train school admins on how to use AI form builder
   - Document common prompts
   - Set up support channel for questions

---

## ✨ Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Descriptive**: "Add a dropdown for blood group with options A+, A-, B+, B-, O+, O-, AB+, AB-" is better than "Add blood group"

2. **One Category at a Time**: Generate contact fields separately from academic fields for better organization

3. **Review AI Output**: Always check the preview before adding. AI might interpret your prompt differently

4. **Test Incrementally**: Add a few fields, test data entry, then add more

5. **Use Standard Terms**: AI trained on common educational terms works best (use "Date of Birth" not "DOB")
