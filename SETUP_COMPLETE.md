## 🎯 First-Time Setup Checklist

### On a New Machine:

#### Windows:
```powershell
# 1. Install Flutter 3.24.0+ from https://flutter.dev
# 2. Clone/copy project
# 3. Open PowerShell in project directory
# 4. Run health check
.\doctor.ps1

# 5. If all checks pass, run app
.\run.ps1
```

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
# 1. Install Flutter 3.24.0+ from https://flutter.dev
# 2. Clone/copy project
# 3. Open terminal in project directory
# 4. Make scripts executable
chmod +x doctor.sh run.sh

# 5. Run health check
./doctor.sh

# 6. If all checks pass, run app
./run.sh
```

---

## 🔍 Verification

Your setup is correct when:

1. **Health Check Passes**
   ```bash
   .\doctor.ps1  # or ./doctor.sh
   # Should show: ✅ All checks passed!
   ```

2. **Dependencies Install**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   # Should complete without errors
   ```

3. **App Runs**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   # Should launch and show login screen
   ```

## 💡 Key Features for Portability

### Cross-Platform Scripts
- PowerShell (`.ps1`) for Windows
- Bash (`.sh`) for Linux/macOS
- Same functionality on all platforms

### Version Management
- `.flutter-version` → FVM (Flutter Version Manager)
- `.tool-versions` → asdf, mise
- Manual check → Scripts compare versions

### No Hardcoded Paths
- Uses relative paths
- Platform-agnostic file operations
- Works regardless of installation location

### Comprehensive Docs
- OS-specific instructions
- Platform-specific troubleshooting
- Architecture diagrams
- API documentation

---

## 🐛 Common Issues (Already Handled)

### Issue: "Flutter not found"
**Solution**: Health check script detects and guides installation

### Issue: "Dependencies failed"
**Solution**: Run script does `flutter clean` first

### Issue: "Long path names" (Windows)
**Solution**: Health check detects and provides fix command

### Issue: "Version mismatch"
**Solution**: `.flutter-version` file enforces correct version

### Issue: "Missing Firebase config"
**Solution**: App works with defaults, health check warns if needed
