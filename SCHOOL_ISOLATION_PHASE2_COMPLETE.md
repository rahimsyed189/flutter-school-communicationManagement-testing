# üéâ School Isolation Implementation - PHASE 2 COMPLETE!

## ‚úÖ ALL PHASES COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ
- Created `SchoolContext` service
- Updated critical collections (users, communications, students, staff)

### Phase 2: Remaining Collections ‚úÖ
- Updated classes collection
- Updated subjects collection  
- Updated custom_templates collection
- All major collections now isolated by schoolId

### Phase 3: Security Rules ‚úÖ
- Created production-ready `firestore.rules.production`
- Enforces school isolation at database level
- Prevents cross-school data access

---

## üìä COMPLETE COLLECTION STATUS

### ‚úÖ Fully Isolated Collections:
1. **users** - Login, registration, user management
2. **registrations** - Pending user approvals
3. **communications** - Announcements, posts
4. **students** - Student records
5. **staff** - Staff records
6. **classes** - Class management
7. **subjects** - Subject management
8. **custom_templates** - Announcement templates
9. **groups** - Group chats (with messages subcollection)
10. **videos** - Video content

### üåê Global Collections (No Isolation):
- `school_registrations` - School configurations (intentionally global)
- `app_config` - App-wide settings
- `cleanup_status` - Cleanup tracking
- `notificationQueue` - Notification queue
- `school_notifications` - Notification templates

---

## üîê SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION

### Current Rules: Development (firestore.rules)
```javascript
// ‚ö†Ô∏è TOO PERMISSIVE - For development only
match /communications/{doc} {
  allow read: if true;         // Everyone can read
  allow create, update, delete: if true; // Everyone can write
}
```

### Production Rules: (firestore.rules.production)
```javascript
// ‚úÖ SECURE - School isolated
match /communications/{doc} {
  allow read: if isSignedIn() && belongsToUserSchool();
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && hasCorrectSchoolId();
  allow update, delete: if isSignedIn() && belongsToUserSchool();
}
```

**Helper Functions:**
- `getUserSchoolId()` - Gets user's schoolId from their user document
- `belongsToUserSchool()` - Checks if document belongs to user's school
- `hasCorrectSchoolId()` - Validates incoming data has correct schoolId

---

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Backup Current Rules
```bash
# Download current rules for backup
firebase firestore:rules:get > firestore.rules.backup
```

### Step 2: Deploy Production Rules
```bash
# Copy production rules to main file
cp firestore.rules.production firestore.rules

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
- Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules
- Check that rules show school isolation logic
- Test with multiple school IDs

## üß™ TESTING GUIDE

### Test 1: Create Two Schools

**In Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore:**

1. Create `school_registrations/SCHOOL_TEST1_ABC123`:
```json
{
  "schoolName": "Test School 1",
  "isActive": true,
  "useSharedDatabase": true,
  "createdAt": "2025-10-22T00:00:00Z"
}
```

2. Create `school_registrations/SCHOOL_TEST2_XYZ789`:
```json
{
  "schoolName": "Test School 2",
  "isActive": true,
  "useSharedDatabase": true,
  "createdAt": "2025-10-22T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### Test 2: Create Test Data

**Login as School 1:**
1. Enter school key: `SCHOOL_TEST1_ABC123`
2. Create some users, students, announcements
3. Note the document IDs in Firestore

**Login as School 2:**
1. Log out and re-enter school key: `SCHOOL_TEST2_XYZ789`
2. Create different users, students, announcements
3. Verify you DON'T see School 1's data

### Test 3: Verify Firestore Documents

**Check in Firebase Console:**
- All documents should have `schoolId` field
- School 1 docs have: `schoolId: "SCHOOL_TEST1_ABC123"`
- School 2 docs have: `schoolId: "SCHOOL_TEST2_XYZ789"`

### Test 4: Try Cross-School Access (Should Fail)

**With Production Rules Deployed:**
1. Login as School 1
2. Try to query School 2's data (should return empty)
3. Try to modify School 2's document (should fail)

## üìù DATA MIGRATION

### For Existing Production Data:

If you have existing data WITHOUT `schoolId`, you need to add it:

#### Option A: Manual (Small Dataset)
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore
2. For each collection (users, communications, etc.)
3. Click each document
4. Add field: `schoolId` = `SCHOOL_YOUR_ID_HERE`

#### Option B: Script (Large Dataset)

**Create:** `scripts/migrate_school_ids.dart`

```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';

Future<void> migrateSchoolIds(String defaultSchoolId) async {
  final firestore = FirebaseFirestore.instance;
  
  // Collections to migrate
  final collections = [
    'users',
    'communications',
    'students',
    'staff',
    'classes',
    'subjects',
    'custom_templates',
    'registrations',
    'groups',
    'videos',
  ];
  
  for (final collectionName in collections) {
    print('üì¶ Migrating collection: $collectionName');
    
    // Get all documents without schoolId
    final snapshot = await firestore
        .collection(collectionName)
        .get();
    
    int migrated = 0;
    int skipped = 0;
    
    // Batch update
    final batch = firestore.batch();
    int batchCount = 0;
    
    for (final doc in snapshot.docs) {
      final data = doc.data();
      
      // Skip if already has schoolId
      if (data.containsKey('schoolId')) {
        skipped++;
        continue;
      }
      
      // Add schoolId
      batch.update(doc.reference, {'schoolId': defaultSchoolId});
      batchCount++;
      migrated++;
      
      // Commit batch every 500 docs (Firestore limit)
      if (batchCount >= 500) {
        await batch.commit();
        print('  ‚úÖ Committed batch of $batchCount documents');
        batchCount = 0;
      }
    }
    
    // Commit remaining
    if (batchCount > 0) {
      await batch.commit();
    }
    
    print('  ‚úÖ $collectionName: $migrated migrated, $skipped skipped');
  }
  
  print('üéâ Migration complete!');
}

// Run with your school ID
void main() async {
  await migrateSchoolIds('SCHOOL_YOUR_ID_HERE');
}
```

**Run migration:**
```bash
dart run scripts/migrate_school_ids.dart
```

## üéØ HOW IT WORKS

### Data Flow Example:

```
User enters school key ‚Üí SchoolContext loads ‚Üí All queries filter by schoolId
```

**1. User Login:**
```dart
// User enters: SCHOOL_ABC_123
await SchoolContext.initialize();  // Loads "SCHOOL_ABC_123"
```

**2. Query Users:**
```dart
// Automatically filters by schoolId
final users = await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('users')
    .where('schoolId', isEqualTo: SchoolContext.currentSchoolId)  // "SCHOOL_ABC_123"
    .get();

// Result: Only users with schoolId="SCHOOL_ABC_123"
```

**3. Create Announcement:**
```dart
// Automatically adds schoolId
await FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('communications').add({
  'schoolId': SchoolContext.currentSchoolId,  // "SCHOOL_ABC_123"
  'message': 'Hello School ABC!',
  'timestamp': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
});

// Result: Announcement only visible to School ABC users
```

**4. Security Rules Enforce:**
```javascript
// Even if app is hacked, rules prevent cross-school access
allow read: if resource.data.schoolId == getUserSchoolId();

// Result: User from School ABC can NEVER see School XYZ data
```

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Missing or insufficient permissions"
**Cause:** Security rules deployed before app updates
**Solution:** 
1. Keep development rules active during testing
2. Deploy production rules only after thorough testing
3. Or add your test user UIDs to rules for testing

### Issue: "No data showing after updates"
**Cause:** Existing data doesn't have `schoolId`
**Solution:** Run migration script to add `schoolId` to existing documents

### Issue: "Queries returning empty"
**Cause:** Wrong schoolId in SchoolContext
**Solution:** 
1. Check entered school key is correct
2. Verify school key exists in `school_registrations`
3. Check console logs for SchoolContext initialization

### Issue: "Cannot create index for schoolId + other field"
**Cause:** Firestore requires composite index
**Solution:**
1. Click the link in error message
2. Creates index automatically
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for index to build

---

## üí° BEST PRACTICES

### Always Remember:
1. **Every collection needs `schoolId`** (except global ones)
2. **Every query must filter by `schoolId`**
3. **Security rules are the final defense**
4. **Test with multiple schools regularly**

### Code Pattern:
```dart
// ‚úÖ CORRECT
await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('collectionName')
    .where('schoolId', isEqualTo: SchoolContext.currentSchoolId)
    .get();

// ‚ùå WRONG
await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('collectionName')
    .get();  // Missing schoolId filter!
```
