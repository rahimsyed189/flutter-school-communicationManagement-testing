### Firebase Collections
The template automatically manages these Firestore collections:

- `app_config/r2_settings`: Stores Cloudflare R2 configuration

### Storage Structure
Media files are organized in Cloudflare R2 storage as:
```
school_notifications/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [timestamp]_0_filename.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [timestamp]_1_document.pdf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [timestamp]_2_video.mp4
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Cloudflare R2 Setup
Before using media attachments, configure R2 storage in Admin Settings:
- Account ID
- Access Key ID  
- Secret Access Key
- Bucket Name
- Custom Domain (optional)

### Firebase Setup
Ensure Firebase is properly configured for:
- Firestore database
- Firebase Messaging for push notifications
- Authentication for admin access

## Security Features

- **Admin-only Access**: Only users with admin role can access this template
- **Secure File Upload**: All files uploaded through secure HTTPS connections
- **Access Control**: Firebase security rules control database access
- **Input Validation**: All form inputs are validated before processing

## Customization Options

The template can be easily customized:

### Categories
Modify the `_categories` list in the code to add/remove notification types:
```dart
final List<Map<String, String>> _categories = [
  {'value': 'custom', 'label': 'üè´ Custom Category'},
  // Add your categories here
];
```

### Styling
Update colors, fonts, and layout by modifying the UI components in the `build()` method.

### File Types
Extend supported file types by updating the `_getMediaType()` and `_getFileIcon()` methods.

## Best Practices

### For School Administrators
1. **Use Clear Titles**: Make notification titles descriptive and specific
2. **Choose Appropriate Categories**: Select the most relevant category for each notification
3. **Optimize Media**: Compress large images/videos before upload to save bandwidth
4. **Test Notifications**: Send test notifications to verify functionality

### For Developers
1. **Error Handling**: Always wrap upload operations in try-catch blocks
2. **Progress Feedback**: Provide clear visual feedback during long operations
3. **Resource Management**: Properly dispose of controllers and disable wake locks
4. **Offline Handling**: Consider implementing offline capability for draft notifications

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance
- Monitor Cloudflare R2 storage usage and costs
- Clean up old notification files periodically
- Update Firebase security rules as needed
- Review and update notification categories based on school needs

### Troubleshooting
- **Upload Failures**: Check R2 configuration and network connectivity
