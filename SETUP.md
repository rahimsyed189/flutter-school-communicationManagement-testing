# School Management System - Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ System Requirements

### Supported Operating Systems
- ‚úÖ Windows 10/11
- ‚úÖ macOS 10.15+
- ‚úÖ Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora, etc.)

### Required Software

- **IDE**: VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (Any OS)

### Step 1: Install Flutter

#### Windows:
```powershell
# Download Flutter SDK
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/windows/flutter_windows_3.24.0-stable.zip" -OutFile "flutter.zip"
Expand-Archive flutter.zip -DestinationPath C:\src\
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\src\flutter\bin", "User")
```

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
# Download Flutter SDK
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable --depth 1
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"

# Add to shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation
```bash
flutter doctor
```

Expected output should show:
- ‚úÖ Flutter (Channel stable, 3.24.0)
- ‚úÖ Android toolchain
- ‚úÖ Chrome (for web development)
- ‚úÖ VS Code or Android Studio

### Step 3: Clone & Setup Project

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/flutterapp

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run code generation (if needed)
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Step 4: Run the App

```bash
# List available devices
flutter devices

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d <device-id>

# Or run on default device
flutter run
```

## üîß Project-Specific Setup

### 1. Firebase Configuration

The app uses Firebase. Ensure you have:

**Option A: Use Existing Firebase (Recommended for Testing)**
- The app already has default Firebase configuration
- No additional setup needed for testing

**Option B: Configure Your Own Firebase**
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Firestore, Authentication, Storage
3. Download configuration files:
   - Android: `google-services.json` ‚Üí `android/app/`
   - iOS: `GoogleService-Info.plist` ‚Üí `ios/Runner/`
   - Web: Update `lib/firebase_options.dart`

### 2. R2 Storage (Optional - For Media Upload)

If using Cloudflare R2 for media storage:
1. Get R2 credentials from Cloudflare dashboard
2. Configure in app (Admin Settings ‚Üí R2 Configuration)

### 3. Platform-Specific Setup

#### Windows:
```powershell
# Enable Windows desktop
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop

# Build for Windows
flutter build windows
```

#### macOS:
```bash
# Enable macOS desktop
flutter config --enable-macos-desktop

# Install CocoaPods
sudo gem install cocoapods

# Build for macOS
flutter build macos
```

#### Linux:
```bash
# Enable Linux desktop
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop

# Install Linux dependencies
sudo apt-get install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev

# Build for Linux
flutter build linux
```

#### Android:
- Android Studio with Android SDK installed
- Accept Android licenses: `flutter doctor --android-licenses`

#### iOS (macOS only):
- Xcode 14.0 or higher
- CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Flutter command not found"
**Solution**: Add Flutter to your PATH
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell as Admin)
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\src\flutter\bin", "Machine")

# macOS/Linux
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"
```

#### 2. "Gradle build failed"
**Solution**: 
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

#### 3. "CocoaPods not installed" (macOS/iOS)
**Solution**:
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
flutter run
```

#### 4. "Version solving failed"
**Solution**:
```bash
flutter clean
rm pubspec.lock
flutter pub get
```

#### 5. "Build failed with exit code 1"
**Solution**: Check syntax errors
```bash
flutter analyze
dart fix --apply
```

#### 6. Long Windows Path Issues
**Solution**: Enable long paths
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" -Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```
