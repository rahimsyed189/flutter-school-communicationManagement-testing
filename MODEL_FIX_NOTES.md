# AI Form Generation - Model Fix

## Issue Found ✅

**Error Message:**
```
Error generating fields with Gemini: models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent.
```

## Root Cause

The `google_generative_ai` package (v0.4.6) doesn't support `gemini-1.5-flash` model name with the current API version. The correct model name for the stable API is `gemini-pro`.

## Fix Applied

**File**: `lib/services/ai_form_generator.dart`

**Changed From:**
```dart
final model = GenerativeModel(
  model: 'gemini-1.5-flash',
  apiKey: apiKey,
);
```

**Changed To:**
```dart
final model = GenerativeModel(
  model: 'gemini-pro',
  apiKey: apiKey,
);
```

## What This Means

- **Model**: Now using `gemini-pro` (Google's stable production model)
- **Performance**: Slightly slower than Flash but more reliable
- **Quality**: Better reasoning and more accurate JSON generation
- **Cost**: Still free tier (60 requests/minute, 1 million tokens/day)
- **Availability**: Stable API, widely available

## Testing After Fix

1. App restarted (hot reload doesn't work for static method changes)
2. Try generating fields again:
   ```
   Add student basic info: name, date of birth, gender dropdown with Male/Female/Other
   ```

3. Should now work without errors!

## Alternative Models (Future)

If you upgrade the `google_generative_ai` package in the future, you can use:

- `gemini-1.5-flash` - Fastest, good for simple tasks
- `gemini-1.5-pro` - Best quality, complex reasoning
- `gemini-pro` - Current stable model (what we're using)

For now, stick with `gemini-pro` as it's fully supported.

## Status

- ✅ Fix applied
- ✅ App restarting
- ⏳ Ready to test
