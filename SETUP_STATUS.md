# Quick Setup Instructions

## âœ… COMPLETED:
- Firebase Functions deployed with `dailyCleanup` function
- Flutter UI created for server cleanup configuration
- AWS SDK integrated for R2 storage cleanup
- **NEW**: R2 credentials read from Firestore (`app_config/r2_settings`)

## ðŸ”§ R2 CONFIGURATION (Automatic from Firestore):

The Firebase Function now reads R2 credentials directly from Firestore:
- Collection: `app_config`
- Document: `r2_settings`
- Fields needed:
  ```json
  {
    "endpoint": "https://YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
    "accessKeyId": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
    "secretAccessKey": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY", 
    "bucketName": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"
  }
  ```

## ðŸš€ READY TO USE:

### Firebase Cleanup (Already Working):
- Runs daily at 2 AM UTC
- Deletes old chats and announcements
- Configurable via Flutter app

### R2 Storage Cleanup (Automatic):
- Uses existing R2 credentials from `app_config/r2_settings`

1. Open Flutter app
2. Admin menu > "Server Cleanup"
3. Set frequency (daily/weekly/monthly)

5. Save settings

### Monitor Status:
- Check "Recent Cleanup Status" in the app
